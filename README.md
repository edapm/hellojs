## Beginners
⭐

So you're started out in the JS world? You've come to the right place! Check out our links and tips below:

### Course Providers (Relevant to all three skill levels)

- [Udacity](https://udacity.com) - some good free and paid courses
- [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com) - great content from leading experts in the field
- [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com) - good step-by-step beginner courses, with an integrated enivronment to help you code with just your browser

## Intermediate
⭐⭐

After learning vanilla JavaScript, the next thing to learn about is frameworks. There are many, but the main four are Angular, React, Vue and Ember. 

> *Frontend Masters (mentioned above) has a really great React course by Brain Holt that I've personally done and can recommend - find it [here](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v5)*

### Framework Websites and Official Docs

- [Angular](https://angular.io) - a popular framework made by Google
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - smaller than Angular, a popular library built at Facebook
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - an alternative framework, very fast
- [Ember](https://emberjs.com) - a framework for "ambitious developers"

### Static Site Generators (SSGs)

Quickly build static sites from Markdown using a static site generator. Popular ones include Gatsby, Eleventy, Gridsome, Hugo and Jekyll.

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) - a React-based SSG, one of the most popular
- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) - a general JS-based SSG
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) - a Vue- and API-based SSG

### Server Side Rendering

Frameworks such as Next and Nuxt which render pages server-side before sending them to the client

- [Next](https://nextjs.org) - a React-based framework
- [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) - a Vue-based framework
